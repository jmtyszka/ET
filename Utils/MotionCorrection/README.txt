ET_motion_correction using EPI motion correction-- JD

as of 05/03/14 -- have to stop developing and concentrate on other project (worked on it one week)

still a few things to iron out

the video stabilization of the eye is not working well.
- it could be a problem with fine temporal alignment- the correction happens a bit before the movement...

also, there is a problem with the direction of the z axis in the eye motion video. 


I am now wondering whether this will truly buy me something. The big limitation is that we cannot account for any of the motion before the scanner starts.

I think that what will matter more is to have a few anchor points in the video, times at which we know what the subject should be looking at. Perhaps ask Dan whether there are such points in his data from outside the scanner. 

What this helped me with is a better understanding of the geometry, and also seeing the huge effects that motion can have, unfortunately, on eye tracking...
