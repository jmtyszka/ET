{"name":"ET","tagline":"Matlab video eye tracking and gaze estimation","body":"### Welcome to the home of ET\r\nThis Matlab package was originally developed to allow gaze estimation from videos of volunteers' eye movements recorded during functional MRI sessions at the [Caltech Brain Imaging Center](http://magnet.caltech.edu). The workflow has two phases:\r\n1. Preparation for analysis. The video is edited for length, rotated if necessary, deinterlaced and MRI artifacts reduced, ready for actual pupilometry.\r\n2. Video pupilometry and gaze estimation. A calibration and gaze tracking video are required for full gaze estimation. \r\n\r\nThere are currently two branches: a master branch designed for Windows 7 and a developmental branch for OS X Mavericks and Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n### \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMany thanks to Julien Dubois (@luckyjuju) and Wolfgang Pauli (@).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with ET?
