Procedure for windows

* start Matlab

* add ET toolbox to path

* convert to mp4 (saves space) - remove .mpg
	> convert_mpg2_to_mp4_win(put_video_in_folder,cleanup,fpsi)
		- put_video_in_folder = 1 if you want to create a folder for the video
		- cleanup = 1 if you want to delete the mpg video after conversion 
		- fpsi = 29.97 (interlaced frame rate, hard-coded)
	
* cut up the video (into Calibration/Validation/Gaze)
	> ET_cut
	
NOTE: Validation video is not used any more in the main interface. However, if calibration is bad, and a validation was recorded, one should have the opportunity to use the validation video as the calibration (*** add toggle switch to interface)

Calibration: find start and end of 9-point calibration (end with a long blink)
Validation : find start and end of 9-point validation
Gaze:  find first artefact (trigger); start = first artefact - 150 (set automatically); end = end of video (set automatically)

* prepare videos
	> ET_prep  


* do pupilometry
	> ET
